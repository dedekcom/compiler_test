# compiler_test

Interpreter of simple language written in Scala. I avoided everything that could be replaced with basic concepts (recursion instead of loops, no elif, no unary operators etc.). Interpreter uses Reverse Polish Notation for computing expressions.

Examples with some code in test/resources/ .
